## About

Qudoro is an intelligent study companion built for students who want more than a basic flashcard app. It combines active recall, spaced repetition, exam practice, and personal progress tracking in one focused workspace.

Instead of juggling scattered notes and random question banks, Qudoro helps you turn what you study into a system: create sets, practice with realistic question flows, identify weak areas, and come back stronger each session.

Whether you are preparing for finals, certification exams, or daily coursework, Qudoro is designed to make studying more structured, more motivating, and more effective.

## Why Qudoro

- Smart review with spaced-repetition style workflows
- Question bank and set builder for organized exam prep
- Practice mode with instant feedback and rationale review
- Notes + flashcard conversion to speed up study creation
- Progress visibility so you know what to improve next
